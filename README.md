# JunctionDeviationSettingPlugin

This plugin adds Junction Deviation settings to the Speed category in the Custom print setup of Cura. The plugin inserts M205 commands in the Gcode to set the Junction Deviation value for Marlin-based printers (that have the CLASSIC_JERK feature disabled).

For more information about Jerk and Junction Deviation, see the Marlin documentation: https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M205.html
